    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence. Its common elements are pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The word derives from Greek μουσική. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions, through improvisational music to aleatoric forms. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art. It may also be divided among art music and folk music. There is also a strong connection between music and mathematics. Music may be played and heard live, may be part of a dramatic work or film, or may be recorded. To many people in many cultures, music is an important part of their way of life. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Martial music or military music is a specific genre of music intended for use in military settings. Much of the military music has been composed to announce military events as with bugle calls and fanfares, or accompany marching formations with drum cadences, or mark special occasions as by military bands. However, music has been employed in battle for centuries, sometimes to intimidate the enemy and other times to encourage combatants, or to assist in organization and timing of actions in warfare. Depending on the culture, a variety of percussion and musical instruments have been used, such as drums, fifes, bugles, trumpets or other horns, bagpipes, triangles, cymbals, as well as larger military bands or full orchestras. Although some martial music has been composed in written form, other music has been developed or taught by ear, such as bugle calls or drum cadences, relying on group memory to coordinate the sounds.</skos:definition>

Children's music is often designed to provide an entertaining means of teaching children about their culture, other cultures, good behavior, facts and skills. Many are folk songs, but there is a whole genre of educational music that has become increasingly popular.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Art music—also known as formal music, serious music, erudite music, or legitimate music —is an umbrella term used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction, e.g., referred to by musicologist Philip Tagg as one of an &quot;axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics.&quot; He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. In this regard, it is frequently used as a contrasting term to popular music and traditional or folk music. The term also covers non-Western classical traditions such as Chinese classical music and Traditional Japanese music.</skos:definition>

World music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category pose obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine's description of the genre as &quot;local music from out there&quot;. The term originated in the late 20th century as a marketing category and academic classification for non-Western traditional music. Globalization has facilitated the expansion of world music's audiences and scope. It has grown to include hybrid sub-genres such as world fusion, global fusion, ethnic fusion and worldbeat.</skos:definition>

It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional music, which are typically disseminated academically or orally to smaller, local audiences. The original application of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as &quot;pop music,&quot; the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for music of all ages that appeals to popular tastes, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre.</skos:definition>

Acid jazz originated in the London club scene of the mid-1980s in the rare groove movement and spread to the US, Japan, Eastern Europe and Brazil. Major acts included Brand New Heavies, Incognito, Us3 and Jamiroquai from the UK and A Tribe Called Quest, Buckshot LeFonque and Digable Planets from the US. The rise of electronic club music in the mid to late 1990s led to a decline in interest, and in the twenty-first century, the movement became indistinct as a genre. Many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are now seen as jazz funk, neo soul or jazz rap.</skos:definition>

It was developed in the early and mid-1940s. It first surfaced in musicians' argot some time during the first two years of American involvement in the Second World War. This style of jazz ultimately became synonymous with modern jazz, as either category reached a certain final maturity in the 1960s.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Blues is a musical form and genre that originated in African-American communities in the &quot;Deep South&quot; of the United States around the end of the 19th century from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. The blue notes that, for expressive purposes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent in relation to the pitch of the major scale, are also an important part of the sound. &lt;p&gt; Blues as a genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as lyrics, bass lines, and instruments. Blues sub-genres include country blues, such as Delta, Piedmont and Texas blues, and urban blues styles such as Chicago and West Coast blues. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues-rock evolved.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Boogie-woogie is an African American style of piano-based blues that became popular after 1928, but originated much earlier in the century, and was extended from piano, to three pianos at once, guitar, big band, and country and western music, and even gospel. While the blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing. The lyrics of one of the earliest hits, &quot;Pinetop's Boogie Woogie&quot;, consist entirely of instructions to dancers: &lt;p&gt; Now, when I tell you to hold yourself, don't you move a peg. &lt;p&gt; And when I tell you to get it, I want you to Boogie Woogie! &lt;p&gt; It is characterized by a regular bass figure, in the left hand. The bass figure is transposed according to the chord changes. &lt;p&gt; It is not strictly a solo piano style, but is also used to accompany singers and as a solo part in bands and small combos. It is sometimes called &quot;eight to the bar&quot;, as much of it is written in common time time using eighth notes. The chord progressions are typically based on I - IV - V - I.</skos:definition>

The audience, often dining or drinking, does not typically dance but usually sits at tables. Performances are usually introduced by a master of ceremonies or MC. The entertainment is often oriented towards adult audiences. &lt;p&gt; Cabaret also sometimes refers to a Mediterranean-style brothel – a bar with tables and women who mingle with and entertain the clientele. Traditionally these establishments can also feature some form of stage entertainment, often singers and dancers or burlesque entertainers.</skos:definition>

A dance form played by contemporary musicians as soloists or in small ensembles of voice, guitar, violin and bombo drum, the Chacarera is often legitimized by its “origin” in the remote province of Santiago del Estero.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Chicago blues is a form of blues music indigenous to Chicago, Illinois. Chicago blues is a type of urban blues. Urban blues evolved from classic blues as a result of the great depression and developed in the first half of the twentieth century during the Great Migration, when Black workers moved from the Southern United States into the industrial cities of the Northern United States such as Chicago. &lt;p&gt; Urban blues started in Chicago and St. Louis, as music created by part-time musicians playing as street musicians, at rent parties, and other events within the black community. For example, bottleneck guitarist Kokomo Arnold was a steelworker and had a moonshine business that was far more profitable than his music. &lt;p&gt; One of the most important early incubators for Chicago blues was the open air market on Maxwell street. The Maxwell street market was one of the largest open air markets in the nation. Residents of the black community would frequent it to buy and sell just about anything. It was a natural location for blues musicians to perform. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and to eventually make their way to blues clubs.</skos:definition>

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas. &lt;p&gt; The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music, it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and sub genres. The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white, working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, along with African American blues and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Disco is a genre of music that was popular in the 1970s, though it has since enjoyed brief resurgences including the present day. The term is derived from discothèque. Its initial audiences were club-goers from the African American, GLBTQ, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in New York City and Philadelphia during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco also was a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other popular groups of the time. &lt;p&gt; In what is considered a forerunner to disco-style clubs, New York City DJ David Mancuso opened The Loft, a members-only private dance club set in his own home, in February 1970. AllMusic claims some have argued that Isaac Hayes and Barry White were playing what would be called disco music as early as 1971. According to the music guide, there is disagreement as to what the first disco song was.</skos:definition>

By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style. &lt;p&gt; Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre &quot;screamo&quot;. In recent years the term &quot;emo&quot; has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Fado is a music genre which can be traced to the 1820s in Portugal, but probably with much earlier origins. Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that &quot;the only reliable information on the history of Fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.&quot; In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness and melancholia. However, although the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is regarded, by many, as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain structure. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word saudade which symbolizes the feeling of loss. Famous singers of fado include Amália Rodrigues, Dulce Pontes, Carlos do Carmo, Mariza, Mafalda Arnauth, António Zambujo, Ana Moura, Camané, Helder Moutinho, Aldina Duarte, Joanna Amandoeira, Ricardo Robeiro, Argentina Santos, Carminho, Mísia, and Cristina Branco.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Flamenco is a form of Spanish folk music and dance from the region of Andalusia in southern Spain. It includes cante, toque, baile and palmas. First mentioned in literature in 1774, the genre grew out of Andalusian and Romani music and dance styles. Flamenco is often associated with the Romani people of Spain and a number of famous flamenco artists are of this ethnicity. Flamenco was first recorded in the late 18th century but the genre underwent a dramatic development in the late 19th century. &lt;p&gt; In recent years flamenco has become popular all over the world and is taught in many countries: in Japan there are more academies than there are in Spain. On November 16, 2010 UNESCO declared flamenco one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. &lt;p&gt; Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted by mouth, as music of the lower classes, and as music with unknown composers. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. One meaning often given is that of old songs, with no known composers, another is music that has been transmitted and evolved by a process of oral transmission or performed by custom over a long period of time. &lt;p&gt; Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the UK around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and Bob Dylan-penned material with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was itself first coined by the U.S. music press to describe The Byrds' music in June 1965, the same month that the band's debut album was issued. The release of The Byrds' cover version of Dylan's &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and its subsequent commercial success initiated the folk rock explosion of the mid-1960s. Dylan himself was also influential on the genre, particularly his recordings with an electric rock band on the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde albums. Dylan's July 25, 1965 appearance at the Newport Folk Festival with an electric backing band is also considered a pivotal moment in the development of folk rock.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Though the music produced by free jazz composers varied widely, the common feature was a dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, which had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Each in their own way, free jazz musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down the conventions of jazz, often by discarding hitherto invariable features of jazz, such as fixed chord changes or tempos. While usually considered experimental and avant-garde, free jazz has also oppositely been conceived as an attempt to return jazz to its &quot;primitive&quot;, often religious roots, and emphasis on collective improvisation. &lt;p&gt; Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John Coltrane. Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Although today &quot;free jazz&quot; is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including &quot;avant-garde&quot;, &quot;energy music&quot; and &quot;The New Thing&quot;.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid to late 1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and R&amp;B. Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing it from R&amp;B and soul songs, which are built on chord progressions. &lt;p&gt; Like much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic &quot;hits&quot;. &lt;p&gt; Many of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively. Funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip hop, house music, and drum and bass. It is also the main influence of go-go, a subgenre associated with funk.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Punk rock is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic, many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels. &lt;p&gt; The term &quot;punk&quot; was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned in London, and Television, and the Ramones in New York City were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Garage rock is a raw form of rock and roll that was first popular in the United States and Canada from about 1963 to 1967. Its name derives from the perception that many often rehearsed in a family garage. &lt;p&gt; The style was characterised by lyrics and delivery that were more aggressive and unsophisticated than in commercial pop music at the time, often, for instance, using guitars distorted through a fuzzbox. It began to evolve from regional scenes as early as 1958, heavily influenced by surf rock. The &quot;British Invasion&quot; of 1964-66 greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience. Thousands of garage bands were extant in the USA and Canada during the era, hundreds produced regional hits, and a handful had national chart hits. By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts. It was also disappearing at the local level as amateur musicians faced college, work or the draft. During the 1960s, it was not recognized as a separate music genre and had no specific name.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Grunge is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American state of Washington, particularly in the Seattle area. The early Grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with Grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. &lt;p&gt; Inspired by hardcore punk and heavy metal, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, &quot;growling&quot; vocals and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared with other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics. &lt;p&gt; Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time.</skos:definition>

It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. &lt;p&gt; Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, Deep Purple, Aerosmith and AC/DC. It reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like Van Halen, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade, before losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes.</skos:definition>

A musical group that plays jazz is called a jazz band. &lt;p&gt; As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, giving rise to many distinctive styles: New Orleans jazz dating from the early 1910s, big band swing, Kansas City jazz and Gypsy jazz from the 1930s and 1940s, bebop from the mid-1940s, Afro-Cuban jazz, West Coast jazz, ska jazz, cool jazz, Indo jazz, avant-garde jazz, soul jazz, modal jazz, chamber jazz, free jazz, Latin jazz, smooth jazz, jazz fusion and jazz rock, jazz funk, loft jazz, punk jazz, acid jazz, ethno jazz, jazz rap, M-Base and nu jazz. &lt;p&gt; Louis Armstrong, one of the most famous musicians in jazz, said to Bing Crosby on the latter's radio show, &quot;Ah, swing, well, we used to call it syncopation, then they called it ragtime, then blues, then jazz.

It is one of several types of music often simply referred to as &quot;jungle music&quot;. The fast tempos, breakbeats and other heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples and synthesized effects make up the easily recognizable form of jungle. Long pitch-shifted snare rolls are common in oldskool jungle. &lt;p&gt; The terms &quot;jungle&quot; and &quot;drum and bass&quot; are often used interchangeably, although whether the two genres are actually distinct is an ongoing topic of debate. For those individuals who consider the two genres as separate entities, drum and bass is usually considered to have departed from jungle in the mid to late-1990s. &lt;p&gt; Producers create the drum patterns, which are sometimes completely off-beat, by cutting apart breakbeats. Jungle producers incorporated classic Jamaican/Caribbean sound-system culture production-methods. The slow, deep basslines and simple melodies accentuated the overall production, giving jungle its &quot;rolling&quot; quality.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Klezmer is a musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. Played by professional musicians called klezmorim, the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924, met and assimilated American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, this was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the current century musicians have begun paying more attention to the &quot;original&quot; pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Yale Strom, and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, late immigrants from the Soviet Union such as German Goldenshtayn brought their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s. &lt;p&gt; Compared to most other European folk music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it must be seen as conjecture.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Progressive rock, also known as prog rock or prog, is a rock music subgenre that originated in the United Kingdom, with further developments in Germany, Italy, and France, throughout the mid-to-late 1960s and 1970s. It developed from psychedelic rock, and originated, similarly to art rock, as an attempt to give greater artistic weight and credibility to rock music. Bands abandoned the short pop single in favor of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz or classical music in an effort to give rock music the same level of musical sophistication and critical respect. &lt;p&gt; Songs were replaced by musical suites that often stretched to 20 or 40 minutes in length and contained symphonic influences, extended musical themes, philosophical lyrics and complex orchestrations. The genre was not without criticism, however, as some reviewers found the concepts &quot;pretentious&quot; and the sounds &quot;pompous&quot; and &quot;overblown&quot;. &lt;p&gt; Progressive rock saw a high level of popularity throughout the 1970s, especially in the middle of the decade.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Krautrock is rock and electronic music that originated in Germany in the late 1960s. The term was popularized in the English-speaking press. Later, German media started to use it as a term for all German rock bands from the late 1960s and 1970s, while abroad the term specifically referred to more experimental artists who often but not always used synthesizers and other electronic instruments. &lt;p&gt; The term is a result of the English-speaking world's reception of the music at the time and not a reference to any one particular scene, style, or movement, as many krautrock artists were not familiar with one another. BBC DJ John Peel in particular is largely credited with spreading the reputation of krautrock outside of the German-speaking world. &lt;p&gt; Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock &amp; roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and New Age music. Key artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon Düül II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Lied is a German and Dutch word literally meaning &quot;song&quot;. It usually describes the setting of romantic German poems to music, especially during the nineteenth century, beginning with Carl Loewe, Heinrich Marschner, and Franz Schubert. Among English speakers, &quot;Lied&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;art song&quot; to encompass works that the tradition has inspired in other languages. The poetry forming the basis for Lieder often centers upon pastoral themes, or themes of romantic love. &lt;p&gt; Typically, Lieder are arranged for a single singer and piano, the Lied with orchestral accompaniment being a later development. Some of the most famous examples of Lieder are Schubert's &quot;Der Tod und das Mädchen&quot; and &quot;Gretchen am Spinnrade&quot;. Sometimes Lieder are gathered in a Liederkreis or &quot;song cycle&quot;—a series of songs tied by a single narrative or theme, such as Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin and Winterreise, or Robert Schumann's Frauenliebe und -leben and Dichterliebe. Schubert, Schumann and Johannes Brahms are most closely associated with this genre, mainly developed in the Romantic era.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A narco-corrido is a sub-genere of the Mexican norteño-corrido music genre, a traditional folk music from northern Mexico, from which other several genres have evolved. This type of music is heard on both sides of the US–Mexican border. It uses a danceable, accordion-based polka as a rhythmic base. The first corridos that focus on drug smugglers—the narco comes from &quot;narcotics&quot;—have been dated by Juan Ramírez-Pimienta to the 1930s. Early corridos go back as far to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, telling the stories of revolutionary fighters. Music critics have also compared narcocorrido music to gangster rap. &lt;p&gt; Narcocorrido lyrics refer to particular events and include real dates and places. The lyrics tend to speak approvingly of illegal activities such as murder, torture, racketeering, extortion, drug smuggling, illegal immigration, and sometimes political protest due to government corruption.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The New Age movement is a Western spiritual movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as &quot;drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and metaphysical traditions and infusing them with influences from self-help and motivational psychology&quot;. The term New Age refers to the coming astrological Age of Aquarius. &lt;p&gt; The movement aims to create &quot;a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas&quot; that is inclusive and pluralistic. It holds to &quot;a holistic worldview&quot;, emphasising that the Mind, Body, and Spirit are interrelated and that there is a form of monism and unity throughout the universe. It attempts to create &quot;a worldview that includes both science and spirituality&quot; and embraces a number of forms of mainstream science as well as other forms of science that are considered fringe. &lt;p&gt; The origins of the movement can be found in Medieval astrology and alchemy, such as the writings of Paracelsus, in Renaissance interests in Hermeticism, in 18th-century mysticism, such as that of Emanuel Swedenborg, and in beliefs in animal magnetism espoused by Franz Mesmer.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Opera is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble. &lt;p&gt; Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition. It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Schütz in Germany, Lully in France, and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe, except France, attracting foreign composers such as Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his &quot;reform&quot; operas in the 1760s.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece—though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pagode is a Brazilian style of music which originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a subgenre of Samba. Pagode originally meant a celebration with lots of food, music, dance and party. In 1978, singer Beth Carvalho was introduced to this music, liked it from the beginning and recorded tracks by Zeca Pagodinho and others. Apparently, as time has gone by, the term &quot;Pagode&quot; has been degraded by many commercial groups who have played a version of the music full of clichés, and there is now a sense in which the term Pagode means very commercial pop, a negative term. &lt;p&gt; Original Pagode developed in the start of the 1980s, with the advent of the band Fundo de Quintal and the introduction of new instruments in the classical samba formation. Pagode lyricism also represented a kind of evolution towards the tradition of malicious and ironic samba lyrics, with a much heavier use of slang and underground terms. &lt;p&gt; The 4-string banjo, whose introduction is mostly credited to Almir Guineto, has a different and louder sound than the cavaco, that loudness was an advantage in acoustic environments, where there are lots of percussion instruments and people singing along. The 4-string banjo is one of the most characteristic instruments of the pagode sound.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The porro is a musical style and dance from the Caribbean region of Colombia. It is a Colombian cumbia rhythm that developed into its own sub-genre. It was originally a folkloric expression from the Sinú River area that evolved into a ballroom dance. It is played mostly by brass bands or orchestras and danced in couples. &lt;p&gt; The two types of folkloric porro are porro palitiao and porro tapao. The term &quot;palitiao&quot; is derived from the way the bombo drum is struck along its rim to produce the sound of a cowbell. This type of porro is associated with the Sinú River and its surrounding cities and towns. Most would agree on San Pelayo, Colombia, Córdoba as its place of birth. This is the reason why it can also take the name of porro pelayero. In orchestrated variants, porro palitiao or pelayero is known as gaita. See La Sonora Cordobesa and Pacho Galán for sample music of porro palitiao and gaita. &lt;p&gt; The porro tapao is associated with the savannas around Cartagena, Colombia. Its birthplace is believed to be the town of El Carmen de Bolívar, Colombia. In orchestrated forms, this type of porro gets the name of porro sabanero.</skos:definition>

Progressive metal blended elements of heavy metal and progressive rock music, taking the loud &quot;aggression&quot; and amplified electric guitar-driven sound of the former, with the more experimental, complex and &quot;pseudo-classical&quot; compositions of the latter. Progressive metal often utilises the conceptual themes associated with progressive rock. Throughout the years, progressive metal has borrowed influences from several other genres, including classical and jazz fusion music. &lt;p&gt; Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success, additionally, heavy metal bands such as Metallica incorporated elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it remains a largely underground genre with a committed fan base.</skos:definition>

It reached a peak in between 1967 and 1969 with the Summer of Love and Woodstock Rock Festival, respectively, becoming an international musical movement and associated with a widespread counterculture, before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. &lt;p&gt; Psychedelic rock influenced the creation of psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul.</skos:definition>

Merriam-Webster defines it as &quot;music that blends punk rock and rockabilly&quot;, another dictionary defines it as &quot;loud frantic rockabilly music.&quot; About.com defines psychobilly as &quot;tak[ing] the traditional countrified rock style known as rockabilly, ramp[ing] up its speed to a sweaty pace, and combin[ing] it with punk rock and imagery lifted from horror films and late-night sci-fi schlock,...[creating a] gritty honky tonk punk rock.&quot; Psychobilly, &quot;while rooted in the twang of rockabilly, owes just as much to the sound of straight up three-chord punk, often with a dose of thrash metal.&quot; &lt;p&gt; Psychobilly is often characterized by lyrical references to science fiction, horror and exploitation films, violence, lurid sexuality, and other topics generally considered taboo, though often presented in a comedic or tongue-in-cheek fashion.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Punta is a Garifuna music and dance style performed at celebrations and festive occasions. Contemporary punta arose in the last thirty years of the twentieth century in Belize, while the earliest notions of the punta dance precede the coming together of the West African tribes and the Amerindian tribes of the Caribbean in the 17th century The diaspora of Garinagu people, commonly called the &quot;Garifuna Nation&quot;, dates back to their origins of the amalgamation of West African slaves and the Arawak and Carib Amerindians. Punta is used to reaffirm and express the struggle felt by those of the indigenous population's common heritage through cultural art forms, such as dance and music and to highlight their strong sense of endurance. Besides Belize, punta also has a following in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Southern Mexico and the United States. Lyrics may be in Garifuna, Kriol, English or Spanish. However, most songs are performed in the indigenous Awarak and Carib-based languages of the Garinagu and are often simply contemporary adaptations of traditional Garifuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Garifuna culture, punta can be performed at wakes, holidays, parties, ancestral celebrations, and other social events. Punta is iconic of Garifuna ethnicity and modernity, and can be seen as a poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sound. Chumba and hunguhungu, circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ragtime is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its main characteristic trait is its syncopated, or &quot;ragged,&quot; rhythm. It began as dance music in the red-light districts of African American communities in St. Louis and New Orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan was an innovator and key pioneer who helped develop the musical genre, and is credited with coining the term ragtime. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; and a string of ragtime hits such as &quot;The Entertainer&quot; that followed, although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Reggaeton is a music genre which has its roots in Latin and Caribbean music. Its sound derives from the Reggae en Español from Panama. The genre was invented, shaped and made known in Puerto Rico where it got its name, most of its current artists are also from Puerto Rico. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European, Asian and African audiences. &lt;p&gt; Reggaeton blends musical influences of Jamaican dancehall and Trinidadian soca with those of Latin America, such as salsa, bomba, Latin American hip hop, and electronica. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish. Lyrics tend to be derived from hip hop. &lt;p&gt; While it takes influences from hip hop and Jamaican dancehall, reggaeton is not precisely the Hispanic or Latin American version of either of these genres, reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm, whereas Latin hip hop is simply hip hop recorded by artists of Latino descent. The specific &quot;riddim&quot; that characterizes reggaeton is referred to as &quot;Dem Bow&quot;. The name &quot;Dem Bow&quot; is taken from the dancehall song by Shabba Ranks that first popularized the beat in the early 1990s, and appears on his album Just Reality.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated to R&amp;B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when &quot;urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat&quot; was becoming more popular. &lt;p&gt; The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning, for example, in the early 1950s it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term &quot;R&amp;B&quot; became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. By the 1970s, rhythm and blues was used as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&amp;B developed, becoming known as &quot;Contemporary R&amp;B&quot;.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, dating to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of American folk and Western musical styles, such as country and bluegrass, with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered &quot;classic&quot; rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of the bluegrass style with rock and roll. The term &quot;rockabilly&quot; itself is a portmanteau of &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;hillbilly&quot;, the latter a reference to the country music that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing and boogie woogie. &lt;p&gt; Defining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, vocal twangs and common use of the tape echo, but the progressive addition of different instruments and vocal harmonies led to its &quot;dilution&quot;. Initially popularised by artists such as Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, the influence and success of the style waned in the 1960s, nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a major revival through acts such as the Stray Cats.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rumba is a family of percussive rhythms, song and ballroom dance that originated in Cuba as a combination of various musical traditions. The name derives from the Cuban Spanish word rumbo which means &quot;party&quot; or &quot;spree&quot;. It is secular, with no religious connections. People of African descent in Havana and Matanzas originally used the word rumba as a synonym for party. Olavo Alén states that over time, &quot;rumba ceased to be simply another word for party and took on the meaning both of a defined Cuban musical genre and also of a very specific form of dance.&quot; The term spread in the 1930s and 1940s to the faster popular music of Cuba, where it was used as a catch-all term, rather like salsa today. Also, the term is used in the international Latin-American dance syllabus, but in reference to a slower dance based on the bolero-son. Ballroom rumba, or rhumba, is essentially son as opposed to the older folkloric rumba. Similarly, the African style of pop music called African Rumba or soukous is also son-based. &lt;p&gt; The term is also used today for various styles of popular music from Spain, as part of the so-called Cantes de ida y vuelta, or music that developed between both sides of the Atlantic. Flamenco rumba is a genre that is entirely different from Cuban rumba.</skos:definition>

Considered one of the most popular Brazilian cultural expressions, samba has become an icon of Brazilian national identity. The Bahian Samba de Roda, which became a UNESCO Heritage of Humanity in 2005, is the main root of the samba carioca, the samba that is played and danced in Rio de Janeiro. &lt;p&gt; The modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is predominantly in a 2/4 tempo varied with the conscious use of a sung chorus to a batucada rhythm, with various stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings and various percussion instruments such as tamborim. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the Second World War and the cultural impact of US music post-war, samba began to use trombones, trumpets, choros, flutes, and clarinets.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Sevdalinka is a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sevdalinka is part of the Bosniak culture, but is also popular across the ex-Yugoslavia region, especially in Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. The actual composers of many sevdalinkas are unknown. &lt;p&gt; In musical sense, sevdalinka is characterized by a slow or moderate tempo and intense, emotional melodies. Sevdalinka songs are very elaborate, emotionally charged and are traditionally sung with passion and fervor. The combination of Oriental, European and Sephardic elements make this type of music stand out among other types of folk music from the Balkans. Like a lot of Balkan folk music, Sevdalinka features very sombre, minor sounding modes, but unlike other types of Balkan folklore it more intensely features minor second intervals, thus hinting to oriental Makams and Phrygian mode. As a result, the melodies are noted for leaving a strong melancholic feeling with the listener. &lt;p&gt; The singer will often impose the rhythm and tempo of the song, both of which can vary throughout the song.</skos:definition>

Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. &lt;p&gt; Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s, the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s, and the third wave ska movement, which started in the 1980s and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s.</skos:definition>

Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States – where music such as that of the Motown, Atlantic and Stax labels was influential during the period of the civil rights movement – and across the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. &lt;p&gt; According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is &quot;music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm &amp; blues into a form of funky, secular testifying&quot;. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the soloist and the chorus, and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds.</skos:definition>

Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a &quot;lilting&quot; swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the phrase ‘swing feel’ where the emphasis is on the off–beat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. &lt;p&gt; The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the Swing Era. The verb &quot;to swing&quot; is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong rhythmic &quot;groove&quot; or drive.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. &lt;p&gt; The initial take on techno arose from the melding of electronic music, in the style of artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra, with African American music styles, including funk, electro, Chicago house and electric jazz. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and fictional themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave being a notable point of reference. Pioneering producer Juan Atkins cites Toffler's phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create. This unique blend of influences aligns techno with the aesthetic referred to as afrofuturism.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ambient music includes forms of music that put an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an &quot;atmospheric&quot;, &quot;visual&quot; or &quot;unobtrusive&quot; quality. To quote one pioneer, Brian Eno, &quot;Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.&quot; &lt;p&gt; As a genre it originated in the United Kingdom at a time when new sound-making devices such as the synthesizer, were being introduced to a wider market. Robert Fripp and Brian Eno popularized ambient music in 1972 while experimenting with tape loop techniques. The Orb and Aphex Twin gained commercial success with ambient tracks. Ambient compositions are often quite lengthy, much longer than more popular, commercial forms of music. Some pieces can reach a half an hour or more in length.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Barbershop vocal harmony, as codified during the barbershop revival era, is a style of a cappella, or unaccompanied vocal music, characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created. Occasional passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts. &lt;p&gt; According to the Barbershop Harmony Society, &quot;Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop seventh chords that resolve primarily around the circle of fifths, while making frequent use of other resolutions.&quot; Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held ad libitum.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a sub-genre of country music. Bluegrass was inspired by the music of Appalachia. It has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English traditional music, and also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements. &lt;p&gt; Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as &quot;Pretty Saro&quot;, &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;, &quot;Cuckoo Bird&quot; and &quot;House Carpenter&quot;, come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from England, however, the lyrics are about Ireland. Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as &quot;Leather Britches&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Polly&quot;, have Scottish roots.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Calypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the early to mid 20th century. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 1600s. &lt;p&gt; The music, which drew upon African and French influences, became the voice of the people, and was characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, which was most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a chantuelle and eventually, calypsonian. As English replaced patois as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Trinidad and Tobago.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Heavy metal is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are often associated with masculinity, aggression, and machismo. &lt;p&gt; The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout the history of the genre. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence, Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as &quot;metalheads&quot; or &quot;headbangers&quot;. &lt;p&gt; During the 1980s, glam metal became a commercial force with groups like Mötley Crüe and Poison.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pop music is a genre of popular music which originated in its modern form in the 1950s, deriving from rock and roll. The terms &quot;popular music&quot; and &quot;pop music&quot; are often used interchangeably, even though the former is a description of music which is popular. &lt;p&gt; As a genre, pop music is very eclectic, often borrowing elements from other styles including urban, dance, rock, Latin and country, nonetheless, there are core elements which define pop. Such include generally short-to-medium length songs, written in a basic format, as well as the common employment of repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and catchy hooks. &lt;p&gt; So-called &quot;pure pop&quot; music, such as power pop, features all these elements, using electric guitars, drums and bass for instrumentation, in the case of such music, the main goal is usually that of being pleasurable to listen to, rather than having much artistic depth. Pop music is generally thought of as a genre which is commercially recorded and desires to have a mass audience appeal.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as &quot;rock and roll&quot; in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. &lt;p&gt; Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Salsa music is a general term referring to what is Cuban and Puerto Rican popular dance music. The term &quot;Salsa&quot; was initially promoted and marketed in New York City during the 1970s. The various musical genres comprising salsa include the Cuban son montuno, guaracha, chachachá, mambo, and to a certain extent bolero. Salsa is the product of genres such as the Puerto Rican bomba and plena. In some cases, the term is also used to describe Dominican merengue, and the Colombian cumbia. Latin jazz, which was also developed in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers, piano guajeos, and instrumental soloists. &lt;p&gt; Salsa is primarily Cuban son, itself a fusion of Spanish canción and guitar and Afro-Cuban percussion, merged with North American music styles such as jazz. Salsa also occasionally incorporates elements of rock, R&amp;B, and funk. All of these non-Cuban elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa. &lt;p&gt; The first salsa bands were predominantly &quot;Nuyorican&quot; or Puerto Ricans migrated to New York. The music eventually spread throughout the Americas. Ultimately, salsa's popularity spread globally.</skos:definition>

Lyrics typically center on love, relationships and feelings. The northern variant of schlager has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic folk songs, with lyrics tending towards melancholic and elegiac themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening music. &lt;p&gt; The word schlager is also a loanword in some languages, where it retained its meaning of a &quot; hit&quot;.

It was especially popular from 1961 to 1966, has subsequently been revived and was highly influential on subsequent rock music. It has two major forms: largely instrumental surf rock, with an electric guitar or saxophone playing the main melody, largely pioneered by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones, and vocal surf pop, including both surf ballads and dance music, often with strong harmonies that are most associated with the Beach Boys. Many notable surf bands have been equally noted for both surf instrumental and surf pop music, so surf music is generally considered as a single genre despite the variety of these styles. During the later stages of the surf music craze, many groups started to leave surfing behind and write songs about cars and girls, this was later known as hot rod rock. Surf music is often referred to as simply surf rock, even though the genre has many forms.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The copla or copla andaluza is a form of Spanish popular song, deriving from the poetic form of the same name. Although the genre has a long heritage, it flourished in the 1940s, and is epitomized by songwriters Antonio Quintero, Rafael de León and Manuel Quiroga. It is also associated with the Catalonian folk-dance, the sardana. &lt;p&gt; One of the first singers of coplas was Raquel Meller. Initially she sang cuplé, which later evolved in Andalusian and Spanish song into the copla as it is known today. Other well-known singers of coplas are Imperio Argentina, Manolo Corrales, Estrellita Castro, Concha Piquer, Miguel de Molina, Lola Flores, Marifé de Triana, Juanita Reina, Manolo Escobar, Juanito Valderrama, Sara Montiel and Antonio Molina. &lt;p&gt; Particularly of note is es: Carlos Cano, who was a key figure in reviving the popularity of the copla in the later 20th century. More recent singers of coplas include Rocío Jurado, Bambino, María Jiménez, Isabel Pantoja, Martirio, and es:Miguel Poveda and, even more recently, Pasión Vega, Clara Montes, Pastora Soler, Aurora Guirado, Diana Navarro, Concha Buika, La Shica and Montse Delgado.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Milonga is a musical genre that originated in the Río de la Plata areas of Argentina and Uruguay. It was very popular in the 1870s. It was derived from an earlier style of singing known as the payada de contrapunto. The song was set to a lively 2/4 tempo, as are most milongas. &lt;p&gt; &quot;Milonga is an excited habanera.&quot; The original habanera divided into four pulses, in a standard two-four where every note was stressed. In becoming milonga, though, all four notes turned strong, as tempo was doubled. The strength of the first beat weakened the fourth giving an almost waltz-like feel to milonga: one-two-three, one-two-three. Habanera is a slower, more explicit sounding one, two, three-four. At least one modern tango pianist believes the polka influenced the speeding up of the milonga. &lt;p&gt; Milonga has a syncopated beat, consisting of 8 beats with accents on the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 7th beats. &lt;p&gt; Regular 2/4 &lt;p&gt; [1] 2 3 4 [5] 6 7 8 &lt;p&gt; Milonga &lt;p&gt; [1] 2 3 [4] [5] 6 [7] 8, sometimes also [1] [2] 3 [4] [5] 6 [7] 8 &lt;p&gt; 332 &lt;p&gt; [1] 2 3 [4] 5 6 [7] 8 &lt;p&gt; Over time, dance steps and other musical influences were added, eventually giving rise to the tango.</skos:definition>

Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson balladée or ballade, which were originally &quot;dancing songs&quot;. Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century and used extensively across Europe and later the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides. The form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century it took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and the term is now often used as synonymous with any love song, particularly the pop or rock power ballad.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Bomba or Bomba del Chota is an Afro-Ecuadorian music, dance and rum al form from the Chota Valley area of Ecuador in the province of Imbabura and Carchi. Its origins can be traced back to Africa via the middle passage and the use of African slave labor during the country's colonial period. Africans brought to labor as slaves in Ecuador brought with them this music form heavily influenced from the Bantu cultures of the Congo. The people dance in pairs to the drums and use improvisation to build relationships between the dancer and lead drummer. &lt;p&gt; This music and dance tends to have a prominent Spanish, mestizo and indigenous influence in the melodies. It could go from a mid tempo to a very fast rhythm. It is usually played with guitars along with the main local instrument which is also called bomba which is a drum along with a guiro and sometimes bombos and bongos. A variation of it is la banda mocha which are groups that play bomba with a bombo, guiro and plant leafs to give melody. &lt;p&gt; Recently it is enjoying some national exposure but outside of the Chota Valley it is mostly popular in cities such as Quito and Ibarra which have important concentrations of afro-chotan people. In these cities sometimes it is played in discothèques and has some public performances as well as popularity among mestizo and indigenous people.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A concerto is a musical composition usually composed in three parts or movements, in which one solo instrument is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band. &lt;p&gt; The etymology is uncertain, but the word seems to have originated from the conjunction of the two Latin words conserere and certamen: the idea is that the two parts in a concerto, the soloist and the orchestra or concert band, alternate episodes of opposition, cooperation, and independence in the creation of the music flow. &lt;p&gt; The concerto, as understood in this modern way, arose in the Baroque period side by side with the concerto grosso, which contrasted a small group of instruments with the rest of the orchestra. The popularity of the concerto grosso form declined after the Baroque period, and the genre was not revived until the 20th century. The solo concerto, however, has remained a vital musical force from its inception to this day.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Dastg?h is a musical modal system in traditional Persian art music. Persian art music consists of twelve principal musical modal systems or dastg?hs, in spite of 50 or more extant dastg?hs, theorists generally refer to a set of twelve principal ones. A dastg?h is a melody type on the basis of which a performer produces extemporised pieces. &lt;p&gt; Each dastg?h consists of seven basic notes, plus several variable notes used for ornamentation and modulation. Each dastg?h is a certain modal variety subject to a course of development that is determined by the pre-established order of sequences, and revolves around 365 central nuclear melodies known as gushehs which the individual musician comes to know through experience and absorption. This process of centonization is personal, and it is a tradition of great subtlety and depth. The full collection of gushehs in all dastg?hs is referred to as the radif. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September – 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, radifs were officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Filin was a Cuban, but US–influenced, popular song fashion of the late 1940s to the early 1960s. The word is derived from feeling, and is sometimes spelled feelín or even el feeling. It describes a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song. &lt;p&gt; The Cuban roots of filín were in the bolero and the canción. It was related to the trova: in fact, filín was sometimes regarded as a renewal or reinvigoration, of the old trova. Some Cuban quartets, such as Cuarteto d'Aida and Los Zafiros, modelled themselves on U.S. close-harmony groups. Others were singers who had heard Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole. Filín singers included César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, who spent a decade in Mexico from 1949 to 1959, Frank Domínguez, the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, and the great singers of boleros Elena Burke and the still-performing Omara Portuondo, who both came from the Cuarteto d'Aida. &lt;p&gt; A house in Havana, where the trovador Tirso Díaz lived, became a meeting-place for singers and musicians interested in filín. Here lyricists and singers could meet arrangers, such as Bebo Valdés, El Niño Rivera, Peruchín, and get help to develop their work.</skos:definition>

The wide distances travelled have introduced a multitude of influences, starting with Indian roots and adding elements of Greek, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Serbian, Czech, Slavic, Romanian, German, Dutch, French and Spanish musical forms. &lt;p&gt; It is difficult to define the parameters of a unified Romani musical style, as there are many differences in melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, and formal structures from region to region. Lyrics to Romani songs are often sung in one or more dialects of the Romani language, and dance frequently accompanies Romani music performance. &lt;p&gt; There is a strong tradition of Romani music in Central and Eastern Europe, notably in countries such as Hungary, Romania and the former Yugoslavia.

High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including quena, harp, siku, accordion, saxophone, charango, lute, violin, guitar, and mandolin. Some elements of huayno originate in the music of the pre-Columbian Andes, especially on the territory of former Inca Empire.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A madrigal is a secular vocal music composition, usually a partsong, of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Traditionally, polyphonic madrigals are unaccompanied, the number of voices varies from two to eight, and most frequently from three to six. It is quite distinct from the Italian Trecento madrigal of the late 13th and 14th centuries, with which it shares only the name. &lt;p&gt; Madrigals originated in Italy during the 1520s. Unlike many strophic forms of the time, most madrigals were through-composed. In the madrigal, the composer attempted to express the emotion contained in each line, and sometimes individual words, of a celebrated poem. &lt;p&gt; The madrigal originated in part from the frottola, in part from the resurgence in interest in vernacular Italian poetry, and also from the influence of the French chanson and polyphonic style of the motet as written by the Franco-Flemish composers who had naturalized in Italy during the period. A frottola generally would consist of music set to stanzas of text, while madrigals were through-composed. However, some of the same poems were used for both frottola and madrigals.</skos:definition>

It originated in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the United States that stretches from Memphis, Tennessee in the north to Vicksburg, Mississippi in the south, Helena, Arkansas in the west to the Yazoo River on the east. The Mississippi Delta area is famous both for its fertile soil and its poverty. Guitar, harmonica and cigar box guitar are the dominant instruments used, with slide guitar being a hallmark of the style. The vocal styles range from introspective and soulful to passionate and fiery. Delta blues is also regarded as a regional variation of country blues.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Musical theatre is a form of theatre that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of the piece – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements of the works. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, culminating with the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan...</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">New wave music is an umbrella term for several late-1970s to mid-1980s pop/rock musical styles with ties to 1970s punk rock. Initially—as with the later post-punk—new wave was broadly analogous to punk rock before branching as a distinctly identified genre, incorporating electronic/experimental music, mod, disco and pop. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including New Romantic and gothic rock. &lt;p&gt; New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more &quot;arty&quot; post-punk, though it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos while arguably exhibiting greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music, aside from its punk influences, include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, the importance of styling and the arts, as well as a great amount of diversity. &lt;p&gt; New wave has been called one of the definitive genres of the 1980s, after it grew partially fixated on MTV. and the popularity of several new wave artists, attributing the exposure that was given to them by the channel.</skos:definition>

The tradition arose in cities like Oran, Relizane, Mostaganem, Chlef and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, primarily among the poor. Traditionally sung by men, by the end of the 20th century, female singers had become common. The lyrics of raï have concerned social issues, such as disease and the policing of European colonies, that affected native populations.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In common usage the Finnish word rautalanka means instrumental rock in general. Some enthusiasts use the term more narrowly to refer to the somewhat distinct style of playing it that has developed in Finland over the years. This article is written from that more narrow point of view. &lt;p&gt; Rautalanka is typically played by a quartet consisting of a lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drum kit. Rautalanka music can also include other instruments and vocals. The heyday of rautalanka was in the early 1960s, but it has enthusiasts even today. Typical features of rautalanka are sharp and clear melodies, fast tempos and extensive use of tape echo, but little or no overdrive or fuzz. What distinguishes rautalanka most clearly from other twangy guitar genres is that the melodies tend to be in minor keys and melancholic, based on folk tunes and schlager songs.</skos:definition>

The revue has its roots in 19th century American popular entertainment and melodrama but grew into a substantial cultural presence of its own during its golden years from 1916 to 1932. Though most famous for their visual spectacle, revues frequently satirized contemporary figures, news or literature. Due to high ticket prices, ribald publicity campaigns and the occasional use of prurient material, the revue was typically patronized by audience members who earned even more and felt even less restricted by middle-class social mores than their contemporaries in vaudeville. Like much of that era's popular entertainments, revues often featured material based on sophisticated, irreverent dissections of topical matter, public personae and fads, though the primary attraction was found in the frank display of the female body.</skos:definition>

In the nineteenth century they were influenced by Flamenco. They have a relatively limited musical pattern but are rich in lyrics based on country life, virgins, country towns, neighborhoods, pilgrimage, and love themes. They are sung by a plethora of local groups, like the Los Romeros de la Puebla, Los Amigos de Gines, Las Corraleras de Lebrija, Cantores de Hispalis, and Los del Río. Every year, dozens of new sevillanas on CD are published. &lt;p&gt; Sevillanas can be heard mainly in fairs and festivals, including the famous Seville Fair, La Feria de Sevilla. There is an associated dance for the music: &quot;Baile por sevillanas&quot;, consisting of four different parts. One can find schools teaching &quot;baile por sevillanas&quot; in nearly every town in Spain. &lt;p&gt; Generally speaking, a sevillana is very lightheated, happy music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Ballet requires years of training to learn and master, and much practice to retain proficiency. It has been taught in ballet schools around the world, which have historically used their own cultures to evolve the art. &lt;p&gt; Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work, which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production. A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker, a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Ballet dance works are choreographed and performed by trained artists. Many classical ballet works are performed with classical music accompaniment and are theatrical and use elaborate costumes and staging, though there are exceptions to this, such as works by George Balanchine.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Chámame is a folk music genre from the Argentine Northeast, Mesopotamia and the south of Brazil. Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul. &lt;p&gt; Jesuit Reductions in the area encouraged cultural growth that lasted until the Jesuits were expelled by the Spanish Crown in the late 18th century. Within this area, Yapeyú Corrientes was a centre of musical culture that many point to as the birthplace of the original Chamamé. Further mixing with instruments such as the Spanish guitar, then the violin and the accordion, finally resulted in what we currently know as &quot;Chamamé&quot;. There are recordings of Chamamé dating back to the early 20th century, and the term 'Chamamé' was already used in 1931, this type of music, prior to that, was often referred to as the Corrientes' Polka. &lt;p&gt; The Chamamé, originally schottische brought by the Volga German immigrants, has considerable Guaraní influence, mixed with the Spanish guitar and the European accordion from those immigrants that arrived in the area at the beginning of the 20th century. &lt;p&gt; Among chamamé figures of note are Raúl Barboza, Tarragó Ros, Antonio Tarragó Ros, Teresa Parodi, Ernesto Montiel, Tránsito Cocomarola, Mario Millán Medina, and modern musicians Chango Spasiuk, Zitto Segovia, Mario Bofill, Alejandro Brittes and Los Núñez con Ruiz Guiñazú.</skos:definition>

The danzón evolved from the Cuban contradanza. &lt;p&gt; The contradanza had English roots and was introduced in Cuba probably by the Spanish who ruled the island for almost four centuries and contributed thousands of immigrants over the centuries. Or, it is possible that it was introduced in 1762 with the short-lived British invasion of Havana, or even through Haitian refugees. &lt;p&gt; In Cuba, these dances were influenced by African rhythmic and dance styles and so became a genuine fusion of European and African influences.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In music, a fugue is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices, built on a subject that is introduced at the beginning in imitation and recurs frequently in the course of the composition. &lt;p&gt; The English term fugue originated in the 16th century and is derived from the French word fugue or the Italian fuga. This in turn comes from Latin, also fuga, which is itself related to both fugere and fugare. The adjectival form is fugal. Variants include fughetta and fugato. &lt;p&gt; A fugue usually has three sections: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation containing the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key, though not all fugues have a recapitulation. In the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style, by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically imitative works. Since the 17th century, the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint. &lt;p&gt; Most fugues open with a short main theme, the subject, which then sounds successively in each voice, when each voice has entered, the exposition is complete.</skos:definition>

The best known Guarania songs are Recuerdos de Ypakaraí, Ne rendápe aju, Mis noches sin ti, Panambí Vera, and Paraguaýpe. &lt;p&gt; The Guarania is highly regarded in the urban areas, but not in the countryside. This is because the people in the countryside prefer faster styles of songs, such as the paraguayan polka, which is danced more.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The jota is a genre of music and the associated dance known throughout Spain, most likely originating in Aragon. It varies by region, having a characteristic form in Aragon, Catalonia Castile, Navarra, Cantabria, Asturias, Galicia, La Rioja, Murcia and Eastern Andalusia. Being a visual representation, the jota is danced and sung accompanied by castanets, and the interpreters tend to wear regional costumes. In Valencia, the jota was once danced during interment ceremonies. &lt;p&gt; The jota tends to have a 3/4 rhythm, although some authors maintain that the 6/8 is better adapted to the poetic and choreographic structure. For their interpretation, guitars, bandurrias, lutes, dulzaina, and drums are used in the Castilian style, while the Galicians use bagpipes, drums, and bombos. Theatrical versions are sung and danced with regional costumes and castanets, though such things are not used when dancing the jota in less formal settings. The content of the songs is quite diverse, from patriotism to religion to sexual exploits. In addition to this, the songs also have the effect of helping to generate a sense of local identity and cohesion.</skos:definition>

The first jùjú recordings were by Tunde King and Ojoge Daniel from the same era of the 1920s when Tunde King pioneered it. The lead and predominant instrument of Jùjú is the Iya Ilu,&quot;' talking drum. Some Jùjú musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the &quot;blind minstrel&quot; Kokoro. &lt;p&gt; Afro-juju is a style of Nigerian popular music, a mixture of Jùjú music and Afrobeat. Its most famous exponent was Shina Peters, who was so popular that the press called the phenomenon &quot;Shinamania&quot;. Afro-juju's peak of popularity came in the early 1990s.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">panlogo is a recreational dance and music form from Ghana, West Africa. It was first played by the Ga ethnih group, most of whom live in and around the capital city, Accra, but is now performed and enjoyed throughout the country. It began in the early 1960s as an innovative dance form, influenced by American rock and roll, and giving the younger Ga generations a point of distinction from their elders. Ghanaian master drummer C.K. Ladzekpo states that kpanlogo &quot;is essentially an urban youth dance-drumming and a symbol of the commitment of a rapidly growing Ghanaian urban neighborhood youth in advocating their perspective in shaping the political vision of post colonial Africa&quot;. The kpanlogo dance is often performed low to the ground, with bent knees and bent back, and frequently features sexually suggestive motions. The music accompanying the kpanlogo dance is drawn from older Ga drumming traditions, such as gome, oge and kolomashie. Kpanlogo music uses three types of instruments: nono, fao, and kpanlogo drums. Nono plays the key pattern or timeline of the music, supported by the fao. It is common to have three kpanlogo drums in an ensemble, in the roles of &quot;male voice&quot;, &quot;female voice&quot; and &quot;master drum&quot;</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Lezginka or Lezghinka is a national dance of the Lezgian people, and of many peoples in the Caucasus Mountains. It derives its names from the Lezgin people. Nevertheless, Georgians, Azeris, Chechens, Lezghins, Ossetians, Circassians, Karachays, Balkars, Abkhazians, Kabardins, Ingush, Ingilos, Mountain Jews, the Russian Kuban and Terek Cossacks and the various ethnicities of Dagestan such as the Avars, Dargwa and Kumyks have their own versions. Lezginka can be a solo, couple or group dance. Men and women are dressed in traditional costumes; men wear a sword adorned on their side and women in long, flowing dresses. The man, imitating an eagle, dances in quick, concise steps; falling to his knees and leaping up quickly. The woman dances quietly, taking light, small steps—giving the appearance of her floating around the floor. When the dance is performed in pairs, the couples do not touch; the woman acknowledges the man, and dances discreetly about him.</skos:definition>

The monumental epic Manas is the most treasured expression of the national heritage of the Kyrgyz people. Composed and sung entirely in oral form by various singers throughout the centuries, Manas is regarded as the epitome of oral creativity. It is considered to be one of the greatest examples of epic poetry, whose importance is not inferior to that of the Homeric epic. As nomads, the Kyrgyz had no written language. However, they excelled in oral composition, which they artistically employed in their traditional poetry and epic songs. As the internationally renowned Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov notes: &quot;If other peoples/nations displayed their past culture and history in written art, the sculpture, architecture, theatre and literature, Kyrgyz people expressed their worldview, pride and dignity, battles and their hope for the future in epic genre.&quot; &lt;p&gt; Today there are about sixty versions of the epic Manas recorded from various epic singers and oral poets.

In year 2012 the congress of Peruvian republic reclared October 7 as marinera day and in Trujillo city is celebrated with a parade and dance expressions. &lt;p&gt; The origin of the Marinera is generally traced back to the Zamacueca.

The right foot comes from the preceding step to the place of starting, while it makes two successive long steps the left foot turns “on its place”. The turn?s completion brings the right foot into anterior fourth position. The woman?s steps are the converse of the man?s, her left foot making the long steps, while her right foot turns on its place. The turn gains smoothness by means of allowing the right knees to touch each other lightly. &lt;p&gt; The Dip. Starting with the right foot in posterior fourth position: during the first beat, sink, on the second beat, rise, transferring the weight to the left foot, gliding the right foot up to third position, on arriving at which it instantly receives the weight again, if the dip is to be repeated.</skos:definition>

Their customs, music, was merged with the native cultures gave rise to mixtures. The specific history of many of these practices has disappeared, but many authors have worked to identify cultural survivals in Afro-descended groups throughout South America. &lt;p&gt; Many dances have been derived from the Saya. Caporales was based on these dances, created and presented to the public for the first time in 1969 by the Estrada brothers who were inspired in the Afro-Bolivian Saya character of the Caporal .

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A shimmy is a dance move in which the body is held still, except for the shoulders, which are alternated back and forth. When the right shoulder goes back, the left one comes forward. It may help to hold the arms out slightly bent at the elbow, and when the shoulders are moved, keep the hands in the same position. In 1917, a dance-song titled &quot;Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble&quot; by Spencer Williams was published, as was &quot;The Jazz Dance&quot;, which included the &quot;Shimmy-She&quot;, among others. Flappers often performed the dance in the 1920s. The origin of the name is often attributed to Gilda Gray, a Polish emigrant to America. An anecdote says that when she was asked about her dancing style, she answered, in heavy accent, &quot;I'm shaking my chemise&quot;. However, in an interview Gilda denied having said this, and earlier usages of the word are recorded. In the late 1910s others were also attributed as being the &quot;inventor&quot; of the shimmy, including Bee Palmer. Mae West, in her autobiography Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It, claimed to have retitled the &quot;Shimmy-Shawobble&quot; as the Shimmy herself, after seeing the moves in some black nightclubs. &lt;p&gt; The move is also known under different names in various folk dances, in Gypsy dances. In Russian this move is called &quot;Tsyganochka&quot;, or &quot;gypsy girl&quot;, and is done by gypsy female dancers to produce a chime of costume decorations made of the sewn-on coins.</skos:definition>

The term, being vague, evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and by the early 19th century came to represent a principle of composing large scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the fugue—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.</skos:definition>

Mariachi began as a regional folk style called “Son Jaliscience” in the center west of Mexico originally played only with string instruments and musicians dressed in the white pants and shirts of peasant farmers. From the 19th to 20th century, migrations from rural areas into cities such as Guadalajara and Mexico City, along with the Mexican government's cultural promotion gradually re-labeled it as Son style, with its alternative name of “mariachi” becoming used for the “urban” form. Modifications of the music include influences from other music such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1980s. Indie rock is extremely diverse, with sub-genres that include indie pop, jangle pop, C86, and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, a number of indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.</skos:definition>

Instead, they blur genres - drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronica, and even folk.</skos:definition>

It emerged in New York and Detroit in the later 1990s, pioneered by acts including Collider, I-F and those associated with Gerald Donald, and is associated with acts including Peaches, Adult, Legowelt, and Fischerspooner. It was popularised by the Electroclash Festival in 2001 and 2002 and subsequent European tours, but faded as a distinctive style in the early 2000s, when it was fused with tech house to form the electro house genre.</skos:definition>

Today, the term is typically used to refer to pop, rock, or praise &amp; worship styles. &lt;p&gt; It has representation on several music charts including Billboard's Christian Albums, Christian Songs, Hot Christian AC, Christian CHR, Soft AC/Inspirational, and Christian Digital Songs as well as the UK's Official Christian &amp; Gospel Albums Chart.

It typically incorporates a combination of musical devices such as strong melodies, clear vocals and crisp vocal harmonies, economical arrangements and prominent guitar riffs. Instrumental solos are usually kept to a minimum, and blues elements are largely downplayed. &lt;p&gt; Recordings tend to display production values that lean toward compression and a forceful drum beat. Instruments usually include one or more electric guitars, an electric bass guitar, a drum kit and sometimes electric keyboards or synthesizers. &lt;p&gt; While its cultural impact has waxed and waned over the decades, power pop is among rock's most enduring subgenres.</skos:definition>

Members and figures associated with Uncle Tupelo formed three major bands in the genre: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets.

Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Many successful Europop artists came from France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, but most were Swedish in origin. &lt;p&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of ABBA. The Swedish four-piece band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored nineteen top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia. &lt;p&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group Eiffel 65 were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group Alcazar. &lt;p&gt; One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more dance and trance oriented.</skos:definition>

The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot;.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Country blues is acoustic, mainly guitar-driven forms of the blues. It often incorporated elements of rural gospel, ragtime, hillbilly, and dixieland jazz. After blues' birth in the Southern United States, it quickly spread throughout the country, giving birth to a host of regional styles. These include Memphis, Detroit, Chicago, Texas, Piedmont, Louisiana, West Coast, Atlanta, St. Louis, East Coast, Swamp, New Orleans, Delta, Hill country and Kansas City blues. &lt;p&gt; When African-American musical tastes began to change in the early 1960s, moving toward soul and rhythm and blues music, country blues found renewed popularity as &quot;folk blues&quot; and was sold to a primarily white, college-age audience. Traditional artists like Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Boy Williamson II reinvented themselves as folk blues artists, while Piedmont bluesmen like Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee found great success on the folk festival circuit. Contemporary country blues artists such as Ramon Goose have fused country blues and African styles of music to create new hybrids. &lt;p&gt; Seminal compilations of pre-WWII country blues recordings assembled in the 1950s are the Anthology of American Folk Music and The Country Blues.</skos:definition>

Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy during the colonial period. Highlife spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gambia and Nigeria via Ghanaian workers, among other West African countries, by the 1930s. It is very popular in Liberia and all of English-speaking West Africa, although little has been produced in other countries due to economic challenges brought on by war and instability. &lt;p&gt; Highlife is characterised by jazzy horns and multiple guitars which lead the band. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound. Joromi is a sub-genre. &lt;p&gt; This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is modeled after an Afro-Cuban guajeo. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 clave motif guajeo shown earlier in this article.

Like much other late 20th century music of Sub-Saharan Africa It uses strong electric bass rhythms and prominent brass. In the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across Africa and to a lesser extent abroad. &lt;p&gt; Makossa, which means &quot; dance&quot; in the Duala language, originated from a Duala dance called the kossa. Emmanuel Nelle Eyoum started using the refrain kossa kossa in his songs with his group Los Calvinos. The style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later. Artists such as Eboa Lotin, Misse Ngoh and especially Manu Dibango, who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; in the early 1970s. The chant from the song, mamako, mamasa, maka makossa, was later used by Michael Jackson in &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;. Many other performers followed suit. The 2010 World cup also brought makossa to the international stage as Shakira sampled the Golden Sounds popular song &quot;Zamina mina&quot;. &lt;p&gt; Makassi is a lighter style of makossa.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Space rock is a subgenre of rock music, the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes, though it was later repurposed to refer to a series of late 1980s British alternative rock bands that drew from earlier influences to create a more ambient but still melodic form of pop music. The term was revived in the 21st century to refer to a new crop of bands including The Flowers of Hell, Comets on Fire, and Flotation Toy Warning who diversely draw upon the ideas and sounds of both waves of the genre's founders.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally &quot;powerful&quot; sound. The term was first used in the middle of the '80s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe, Latin America and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pop punk is a fusion music genre that combines elements of punk rock with pop music to varying degrees. The music typically combines fast punk tempos, chord changes and loud guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes. &lt;p&gt; Pop-influenced punk rock emerged in the mid 1970s in multiple countries, and was stylistically similar to power pop. By the early 1980s, several bands merged hardcore punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself approach to releasing music. In the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands sold millions of records and received extensive radio and television airplay. A second wave of pop punk in the late 1990s represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. The genre generally waned in popularity by the late 2000s, although it still retains a smaller but dedicated following.</skos:definition>

The style rose to prominence during the 1980s in Chicago and New York. Hip house originated in Chicago and quickly became popular across the U.S. and in the UK, with tracks like &quot;Rok Da House&quot; by UK producers the Beatmasters featuring British female emcees the Cookie Crew. &lt;p&gt; Minor controversy ensued in 1989 when a U.S. record called &quot;Turn Up the Bass&quot; by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the &quot;first hip house record on vinyl&quot;. The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that &quot;Rok Da House&quot; had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released &quot;Who’s in the House?&quot; featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines &quot;Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention&quot; and &quot;Watch out Tyree, we come faster&quot;. More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down in tracks by Fast Eddie, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, and Toni Scott.</skos:definition>

It remains primarily popular in the area as a uniquely regional music style. A great number of bands contributed to the early evolution of the genre, but the Young Senators, Black Heat, and singer-guitarist Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers are credited with having developed most of the hallmarks of the style. &lt;p&gt; Inspired by artists such as the groups formerly mentioned, Go-Go. is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip-hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and funk-style jamming in place of dance tracks, although some sampling is used. As such, it is primarily a dance hall music with an emphasis on live audience call and response. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion. &lt;p&gt; In technical terms, &quot;Go-go's essential beat is characterized by a syncopated, dotted rhythm that consists of a series of quarter and eighth notes … which is underscored most dramatically by the bass drum and snare drum, and the hi-hat… [and] is ornamented by the other percussion instruments, especially by the conga drums, timbales, and hand-held cowbells.&quot;</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Oldskool jungle, or simply jungle, is a genre of electronic music that incorporates influences from other genres, including breakbeat hardcore and reggae/dub/dancehall. It is one of several types of music often simply referred to as &quot;jungle music&quot;. The fast tempos, breakbeats and other heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples and synthesized effects make up the easily recognizable form of jungle. Long pitch-shifted snare rolls are common in oldskool jungle. &lt;p&gt; The terms &quot;jungle&quot; and &quot;drum and bass&quot; are often used interchangeably, although whether the two genres are actually distinct is an ongoing topic of debate. For those individuals who consider the two genres as separate entities, drum and bass is usually considered to have departed from jungle in the mid to late-1990s. &lt;p&gt; Producers create the drum patterns, which are sometimes completely off-beat, by cutting apart breakbeats. Jungle producers incorporated classic Jamaican/Caribbean sound-system culture production-methods. The slow, deep basslines and simple melodies accentuated the overall production, giving jungle its &quot;rolling&quot; quality.</skos:definition>

The lyrics are often based on political consciousness, Afrocentrism, and general positivism. Allmusic writes that the genre &quot;was an attempt to fuse African-American music of the past with a newly dominant form of the present, paying tribute to and reinvigorating the former while expanding the horizons of the latter&quot;. Musically, the rhythms have been typically those of hip hop rather than jazz, over which are placed repetitive phrases of jazz instrumentation: trumpet, double bass, etc. The amount of improvisation varies between artists: some groups improvise lyrics and solos, while many of them do not. A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and Digable Planets are pioneers of the jazz rap genre.</skos:definition>

Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&amp;B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&amp;B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence. &lt;p&gt; Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, in the United States and United Kingdom, as a soul &quot;revival&quot; movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several neo soul artists that were marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&amp;B of the time. Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&amp;B, it has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both African-American and international artists.</skos:definition>

The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C &amp; Plink Plonk, Heart &amp; Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen.

It features four-on-the-floor rhythms and is usually faster than most other dance music genres, at roughly 145 to 170 bpm, and sometimes features pornographic lyrics. As DJ Godfather puts it, &quot;the beats are really gritty, really raw, nothing polished.&quot; &lt;p&gt; Ghettotech was born as a DJing style, inspired by the eclecticism of The Electrifying Mojo and the fast-paced mixing and turntablism of The Wizard, with DJs mixing genres including jungle, ghetto house, hip hop, R&amp;B, electro and Detroit techno. The general BPM of the music's mixing style increases over time. &lt;p&gt; Ghettotech is an integral part of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, an annual event. A Detroit ghettotech style of dancing is called the jit. It is an improvisational dance that mainly centers around the fast movement of the feet. Chicago's equivalent dance style is Juke, where the focus is on the footwork dating back to the late 1980s.</skos:definition>

Bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Huggy Bear, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Skinned Teen, Calamity Jane, Emily's Sassy Lime, Sleater-Kinney, and also queercore like Team Dresch and The Butchies. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Happy hardcore, also known as happycore, is a genre of music typified by a very fast tempo, often coupled with solo vocals and sentimental lyrics. Its characteristically 4/4 beat &quot;happy&quot; sound distinguishes it from most other forms of hardcore techno, which tend to be &quot;darker&quot;. It is typically in a mode with a major third, like Ionian or Lydian. In its original incarnation, it was often characterized by piano riffs, synthetic stabs and spacey effects. This genre of music is closely related to the typically Dutch genre of gabber. Happy hardcore evolved from breakbeat hardcore around 1991–1993, as the original house music-based rave became faster and began to include breakbeats, evolving into oldschool jungle which evolved into drum and bass. Some of the most famous artists of this genre include DJ Brisk, Scott Brown, Darren Styles, Hixxy, DJ Paul Elstak, Dune, Scooter, Stu Allan, Dougal, and DJ Gammer.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Jangle pop is a genre of alternative rock from the mid-1980s that &quot;marked a return to the chiming or jangly guitars and pop melodies of the '60s&quot;, as exemplified by The Byrds, with electric twelve-string guitars and power pop song structures. Mid-1980s jangle pop was a non-mainstream &quot;pop-based format&quot; with &quot;some folk-rock overtones&quot;. Between 1983 and 1987, the description &quot;jangle pop&quot; was, in the US, used to describe bands like R.E.M., Let's Active and Tom Petty, and a subgenre called &quot;Paisley Underground&quot;, which incorporated psychedelic influences. In the UK the term was applied to the new wave of raw and immediate sounding melodic guitar-bands collected on the NME's C86 compilations.</skos:definition>

Also written nü-jazz or NuJazz, it is sometimes called electronic jazz, electro-jazz, electric jazz, e-jazz, jazztronica, jazz house, phusion, neo-jazz, future jazz or Jazz-hop and electro-lounge. &lt;p&gt; According to critic Tony Brewer, &lt;p&gt; “Nu Jazz is to Jazz what punk or grunge was to Rock, of course. [...] The songs are the focus, not the individual prowess of the musicians. Nu Jazz instrumentation ranges from the traditional to the experimental, the melodies are fresh, and the rhythms new and alive. It makes Jazz fun again.”</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Downtempo is a type of electronic music style similar to ambient music, but usually with a beat or groove. The tempo, as well as the drum patterns of each track can vary. Sometimes the beat can be restrained and/or simple. Sometimes the beats are more complicated and more featured instead of being in the background, but even then they are usually less intense than other kinds of electronic music like trance and house. The tempo is often slower than that of traditional electronic dance music. Often the name chill-out music is used to refer to songs demonstrative of the genre, but those names also refer to other styles of music, and downtempo encompasses a wider variety of styles than those terms alone would indicate. Due to the relaxing and often sensual or romantic feel of most downtempo music, it is a popular form of background music in 'chill out rooms' of dance parties, and many alternative cafes.</skos:definition>

Originally limited to simple melodies by early sound synthesizer technology, video game music has grown to include the same breadth and complexity associated with television and movie soundtracks. While simple synthesizer pieces are still common, game music now can include full orchestral pieces and licensed popular music. Video games can now also generate or alter their soundtrack based on the player's current actions or situation, such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games. With the expansion of the video game market, artists going between popular music, classical music, the film industry and video games has become more common. Composers and artists famous for other music—such as film composers Harry Gregson-Williams, Trent Reznor and Hans Zimmer—have worked on soundtracks for recent games, while Michael Giacchino, now normally known for his film scores, began with Mickey Mania and continued with the Medal of Honor series.</skos:definition>

The genre is similar to and sometimes overlaps with deathrock, although deathrock leans more towards an atmospheric Gothic rock sound while horror punk leans towards a 1950s-influenced doo-wop and rockabilly sound. Horrorpunk music is typically more aggressive and melodic than deathrock. &lt;p&gt; The Misfits are recognized as the progenitors of horror punk, releasing a series of singles and EPs beginning in 1977 before releasing their first full-length album Walk Among Us in 1982. &lt;p&gt; Horror punk is generally apolitical in comparison to other punk rock subgenres, although some songs do refer to political events, and some artists like Jack Grisham and Michale Graves have espoused their own political views. &lt;p&gt; Horror hardcore, refers to a hybrid of horror punk and hardcore punk. The Misfits' 1983 album Earth A.D. inaugurated this style and the bands Septic Death, The Banner, and Integrity have also been categorized into this subgenre.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">New jack swing or swingbeat is a fusion genre spearheaded by Teddy Riley and Bernard Belle that became popular from the late-1980s into the early 1990s. Its influence, along with hip-hop, seeped into pop culture and was the definitive sound of the inventive black New York club scene. It fuses the rhythms, samples, and production techniques of hip-hop and dance-pop with the urban contemporary sound of R&amp;B. The new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did, by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities. It used R&amp;B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation. The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop &quot;swing&quot; beats created by drum machine, and hardware samplers, which was popular during the golden age of hip hop, with contemporary R&amp;B style singing. &lt;p&gt; Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines new jack swing as &quot;pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of traditional jazz, electronica, smooth jazz, funk, rap, and rhythm and blues.&quot;</skos:definition>

Prominent musicians working in this area include Toshimaru Nakamura, Sachiko M, Yoshihide Otomo, Tetuzi Akiyama, and Taku Sugimoto. &lt;p&gt; It influenced the development of electroacoustic improvisation or EAI, a genre with which it is strongly intertwined.

It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, double kick or blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and multiple tempo changes. &lt;p&gt; Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s. Bands such as Venom, Slayer, and Kreator, were important influences on the genre's creation. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner, began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate. Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Electroacoustic music originated in Western art music during the modern era following the incorporation of electric sound production into compositional practice. The initial developments in electroacoustic music composition during the 20th century are associated with the activities of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales at the ORTF in Paris, the home of musique concrete, the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk studio in Cologne, where the focus was on the composition of elektronische Musik, and the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York, where tape music, electronic music, and computer music were all explored.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Space disco is the fusion of disco music with futuristic themes, sounds and visuals, a genre that became popular in the late 1970s. The main idea behind the genre is that of an exploration of the wonders of outer space by humans, and many bands often included robotic shapes, laser illumination and computer screens sequence in their live performances. The artists themselves often dressed in a manner inspired by glam rock and somewhat futuristic fashion. &lt;p&gt; Upon reaching Eastern Europe after 1980, the futuristic act was mainly dropped as many socialist state authorities often denied access to the stage for &quot;inappropriately&quot; dressed artists. Many bands then began performing at free, open-music events, festivals and formations to avoid political suppression, and the genre itself was slowly assimilated into purely instrumental, almost orchestral form.</skos:definition>

The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The term &quot;crust&quot; was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 Ripper Crust demo. &lt;p&gt; Crust is partly defined by its &quot;bassy&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be grunted, growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from heavy metal band Black Sabbath and the anarcho-punk of Discharge and the extreme metal of bands like Venom, Celtic Frost and Motörhead. While the term was first associated with Amebix have been described as the originators of the style.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Western swing music is a subgenre of American country music that originated in the late 1920s in the West and South among the region's Western string bands. It is dance music, often with an up-tempo beat, which attracted huge crowds to dance halls and clubs in Texas, Oklahoma and California during the 1930s and 40s until a federal war-time nightclub tax in 1944 led to its decline. &lt;p&gt; The movement was an outgrowth of jazz, and similarities with Gypsy jazz are often noted. The music is an amalgamation of rural, cowboy, polka, folk, Dixieland jazz and blues blended with swing, and played by a hot string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the steel guitar. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included overtones of bebop. &lt;p&gt; Western swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven big swing bands of the same era. In Western bands—even the fully orchestrated bands—vocals and other instruments followed the fiddle's lead.</skos:definition>

As a niche genre, nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic, and has a history of self-publishing and self-production. &lt;p&gt; Though nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction, there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter, including Star Wars, role-playing games, science, fantasy and computers. &lt;p&gt; Music with similar themes, but different musical styles can be found in the filk genres. There are hip hop artists who have recorded compositions which focus on similar topics, but who are not generally considered nerdcore.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Blues rock is a musical genre combining bluesy improvisations over the twelve-bar blues and extended boogie jams with rock and roll styles. The core of the blues rock sound is created by the electric guitar, piano, bass guitar and drum kit, with the electric guitar usually amplified through a tube guitar amplifier, giving it an overdriven character. &lt;p&gt; The style began to develop in the mid-1960s in Britain and the United States. British bands, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds and the Animals and American bands such as the Butterfield Blues Band and the Siegel–Schwall Band, experimented with music from older African-American bluesmen, like Albert King, Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson, Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters and B.B. King. While the early blues rock bands &quot;attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records&quot;, by the 1970s, blues rock got heavier and more riff-based. By the &quot;early '70s, the lines between blues rock and hard rock were barely visible&quot;, as bands began recording rock-style albums.</skos:definition>

The sound became prominent in the northern United Kingdom rave scene before it broke into the hardcore homeland of the Netherlands through Paul Elstak, where it became known there as happy hardcore and funcore. &lt;p&gt; A subsequent mainstream-aimed Eurodance tangent appeared in Germany and itself back into the Netherlands. The music of Brown also changed the Southern England happy breakbeat style away from its breakbeat foundation and into a bouncy derivative. These different country entrails created a single pan European hardcore briefly in the mid-1990s. Bouncy techno rapidly declined from this point for a variety of reasons.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Eurodance is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the late 1980s primarily in Europe. It combines many elements of house, techno, hi-NRG and Euro disco. Eurodance production continues to evolve with a more modernized style that incorporates more elements from trance music. &lt;p&gt; This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich melodic vocals, either exclusively by itself or inclusively with rapped verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizer, strong bass rhythm and melodic hooks, establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music. &lt;p&gt; It peaked at Ibiza's summer festivals of 1994 in Spain and its intense popularity then spread around the world, which carried on into late 1997.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop music that evolved from hardcore hip hop. The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A attracted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Some gangsta rappers have been associated, or allegedly have ties with the Bloods or Crips gangs. &lt;p&gt; The subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy. Criticism has come from both left wing and right wing commentators, as well as religious leaders, who have accused the genre of promoting crime, serial killing, violence, profanity, sex addiction, homophobia, racism, promiscuity, misogyny, rape, street gangs, drive-by shootings, vandalism, thievery, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, disregarding law enforcement, materialism, and narcissism. The White House administrations of both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton criticized the genre.</skos:definition>

It is also the name of a radio format. &lt;p&gt; Modern derivatives of the genre include the more-recent New Adult Contemporary format of broadcast radio. &quot;Smooth jazz&quot; was once successful as a radio format, however, in 2007, the popularity of the format began to slide. Consequently, it was abandoned by several high-profile radio stations across the U.S.A., including WQCD in New York, WJJZ in Philadelphia, and KKSF in San Francisco. Many industry insiders have speculated that the smooth jazz format may die out, particularly with many of industry giant Clear Channel Communications' stations dropping the genre. Critics of the company, however, blame Clear Channel for the format's decline, citing too much repetition of a sharply-reduced number of tracks on Clear Channel-owned stations that alienated many listeners. Despite the format's demise on commercial radio, a growing number of non-commercial stations have taken up the music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A rap opera or hip hopera is a series of hip hop songs in the form of an opera, inspired by the concept of rock opera. Examples of a hip hopera include Trapped in the Closet by R. Kelly, A Prince Among Thieves by Prince Paul, Refletchons by Fletch, and Deltron 3030. &lt;p&gt; Like its predecessor, rap opera tells a story through consecutive pieces of music involving the same character or characters. Rap opera may be a purely auditory experience, or it may be associated with a musical, comic book, or other art form. It is a relatively young, spontaneous form, performed more by amateurs and non-profit groups than by professional emcees. &lt;p&gt; When R&amp;B singer R. Kelly was asked on IFC how he defined his Trapped in the Closet series, Kelly stated that he described it as a hip hopera or musical opera, and that it was now too long to be called a song. In 2001, MTV debuted a telefilm titled Carmen: A Hip Hopera, directed by Robert Townsend and starring Beyoncé Knowles and Mekhi Phifer. Volume 10 also released an album called Hip-Hopera in 1994. The former is contemporary R&amp;B, not hip hop music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Post-disco was an era in popular music history. It began in the late 1970s with the backlash against disco music in the United States, starting in Chicago, Illinois and spreading elsewhere, and ended with the mainstream appearance of house music in the late 1980s. Post-disco can also mean a disco movement initially of urban contemporary artists that started in the New York City area partially in response to over-commercialization and artistic downfall of disco culture. &lt;p&gt; During the late 1970s and early 1980s post-disco styles were developed by a mixed community of DJs and producers. Relative to disco much of this music displayed an increasingly electronic character and it featured &quot;radically different sounds&quot; to the former. The music tended to be technology-centric, keyboard-ladden, melodic, with funk-oriented bass lines, synth riffs, dub music aesthetics, and background jazzy or blues-y piano layers. Strings and brass section synthesizer sounds were preferred to the lush orchestration heard on many disco tracks, although such arrangements would later resurface in some house music. Soulful female vocals, however, remained an essence of post-disco.</skos:definition>

Italo disco was often referred to as Eurobeat, probably due to the negative connotations of the word &quot;disco&quot; in the United States in the 1980s. &lt;p&gt; &quot;Eurobeat&quot; is also directly related to the Japanese Para Para dance culture, but in a completely different way, explained later in this article.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early- to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding music genres – including thrash metal, industrial music, noise music and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk, such as crust punk. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. &lt;p&gt; A trait of grindcore is the &quot;microsong&quot;. Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second &quot;You Suffer&quot;. Many bands record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Street punk is a working class-based genre of punk rock which took shape in the early 1980s, partly as a rebellion against the perceived artistic pretensions of the first wave of British punk. Street punk emerged from the Oi! style, performed by bands such as Sham 69, Angelic Upstarts, Cockney Rejects, The Exploited, and Cock Sparrer. However, street punk continued beyond the confines of the original Oi! form. Street punks generally have a much more outlandish appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Street punks often have multi-coloured hair, mohawks, spike-encrusted leather vests, and clothing with political slogans or the names of punk bands.</skos:definition>

Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot; by MARRS, &quot;House Nation&quot; by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House, &quot;Theme from S'Express&quot; by S'Express and &quot;Doctorin' the House&quot; by Coldcut in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide. &lt;p&gt; Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself.</skos:definition>

Indie pop was inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. &lt;p&gt; The term &quot;indie&quot; had been used for some time to describe artists on independent labels, but the key moment in the naming of &quot;indie pop&quot; as a genre was the release of NME's C86 tape in 1986. The compilation featured, among other artists, Primal Scream, the Pastels, and the Wedding Present, and &quot;indie&quot; quickly became shorthand for a genre whose defining conventions were identified as jangling guitars, a love of '60s pop, and melodic power pop song structures.</skos:definition>

Discharge may have themselves inherited the beat from Motörhead. The first such group was The Varukers. D-beat is closely associated with crust punk, which is a heavier, more complex variation. The style was particularly popular in Sweden, and developed there by groups such as Crude SS, Anti Cimex, Mob 47, Driller Killer, and No Security. Other D-beat groups include Doom, from the UK, Disclose, from Japan, Crucifix and Final Conflict, from the U.S., Ratos de Porão, from Brazil, and MG15, from Spain. While the style initially developed in the early 1980s, a number of new groups working within the subgenre emerged in the mid-1990s. These include the Swedish groups Wolfbrigade, Totalitär, Avskum, Skitsystem and Disfear.</skos:definition>

Typically popular in Italy, Britain and United States since the late 1980s, it fuses house music and Italo disco. The genre's main musical characteristic is its use of predominantly electronic piano chords in a more lyrical form than classic Chicago House records. The best known example is Black Box's Ride On Time, but the genre became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the uplifting and anthemic tunes against the background of indie-dance.</skos:definition>

Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname Opera Metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish Nightwish and Dutch Epica, both of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.</skos:definition>

An early form of electronic dance music, Italo disco faded in the late 1980s when Italo house eclipsed it. &lt;p&gt; Italo disco borrowed elements from traditional disco music, yet was more electronic.

Musicians and bands John Hartford, New Grass Revival, J.D. Crowe and the New South, The Dillards, Boone Creek, Country Gazette, and the Seldom Scene pioneered innovations in the genre. Some groups began using electric instruments and importing songs from other genres, particularly rock &amp; roll. Progressive bluegrass became popular in the late 1960s and 1970s, but it can be traced back to the banjo and contrabass duets that Earl Scruggs played even in the earliest days of the Foggy Mountain Boys. The four key distinguishing elements of progressive bluegrass are instrumentation, frequently including electric guitars, drums, piano, and more, songs imported or styles imitated from other musical genres like jazz, rock and others, non-traditional chord progressions, lengthy &quot;jam band&quot;-style improvisation. However, not all these elements are always present in progressive bluegrass. &lt;p&gt; Progressive bluegrass continues to be performed by bands today.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Disco polo is a musical genre native to Poland, which exists in its present form since the early 1990s, with a peak in 1995-1997. It was derived from the Disco, Euro disco contemporary folk tunes influenced by Italo disco and Polish folk songs. &lt;p&gt; The name itself was conceived by S?awomir Skr?ta from the group Blue Star as a replacement for an older term, piosenka chodnikowa - which originated from the main means of distribution of its recordings in early 1990s - sidewalk stalls on streets and at bazaars. Disco polo could be heard mostly at country picnics, country depots, weddings or during political campaigning for Polish parliament and presidential elections. Former president Aleksander Kwa?niewski was one of the most notable example of a politician who used disco polo during his presidential campaign. &lt;p&gt; Traditional instrumentation came to be replaced by keyboards later in the '90s, which contributed to a slight change in style, making the songs more similar to modern dance music. The style was extensively marketed by the Polsat TV station, which produced its own disco polo hit list, in a TV show called Disco Relax.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pop rock is a music genre which mixes a catchy pop style and light lyrics in its guitar-based rock songs. There are varying definitions of the term, ranging from a slower and mellower form of rock music to a subgenre of pop music. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Electronic rock, also commonly referred to as synthrock, electrorock, techno-rock, or digital rock is rock music generated with electronic instruments. It has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. &lt;p&gt; In the late 1960s rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound, by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s. After the arrival of punk rock a form of basic synth rock emerged, increasingly using new digital technology to replace other instruments. In the 1980s more commercially oriented synth pop dominated electronic rock. In the 1990s big beat and industrial rock were among the most important new trends and in the new millennium the spread of recording software led to the development of new distinct genres including indietronica, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave.</skos:definition>

The sub genre was the evolution of new jack swing, which had incorporated hip-hop influences into R&amp;B music. By contrast, hip hop soul is, as described in The Encyclopedia of African American Music, &quot;quite literally soul singing over hip hop grooves.&quot; &lt;p&gt; The genre was most popular during the mid 1990s with artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, TLC, R. Kelly, Aaliyah, and Montell Jordan. By the late 1990s, hip hop soul would lead to the creation of neo soul, which retained the hip-hop and R&amp;B/gospel influences while also adding elements of classic 1970s soul music.</skos:definition>

It consists of screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, and screamed, distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms.

More recently, scholars have included British rock music from the 1960s and 1970s that utilizes South Asian musical materials and instruments and Western ideas of South Asia. &lt;p&gt; Raga rock is not normally considered a specific genre of music, but rather a general aspect of any rock significantly influenced by Indian classical music. Since Indian influences are primarily limited to 1960s rock, most raga rock is limited to that decade, although heavily Indian-derived sounds are found in some post-1960s rock.</skos:definition>

The trend continued in 2005 when country artists Big &amp; Rich introduced Cowboy Troy to the country world via 2005's &quot;Loco Motive&quot; released on Warner Brothers, which reached #2 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. Coming off the success of Bubba Sparxxx's platinum album debut, Houchins soon after created Average Joes Entertainment with country rapper Colt Ford. This was the beginning of country rap taking its place as a real and separate genre while at the same time influencing mainstream country. Colt Ford has sold over 1.5 million albums including 3 that have landed in the top 10 of Billboard's Country Music chart. Ford's 2012 &quot;Declaration Of Independence&quot; debuted at #1 proving that country rap is a true genre and spawning a slew of new artists.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Chopped and screwed refers to a technique of remixing hip hop music which developed in the Houston hip hop scene in the 1990s. This is accomplished by slowing the tempo down to between 60 and 70 quarter-note beats per minute and applying techniques such as skipping beats, record scratching, stop-time, and affecting portions of the music to make a &quot;chopped-up&quot; version of the original. DJ Screw is largely recognized as the innovator behind the chopped and screwed genre. DJ Screw's key technique involved playing the same record on both turntables with a delay between them of one beat, and quickly moving the crossfader side to side. This created an effect where words or sounds would be repeated in the music but would still keep the tempo going. A subgenre called ChopNotSlop created by OG Ron C has gotten major attention via Drake's Take Care album and the Houston music scene started by SUC</skos:definition>

The breaks are less cut-up sounding rather than oldschool jungle, and have faster and harder simple electronic melodies. One characteristic is an accentuated, yet sparse percussive beat. &lt;p&gt; The genre found favour with junglists, despite being overtaken in popularity by techstep, the fans of the style still remain. Nowadays, hardstep is particularly popular in the North American drum and bass scene, with artist like Evol Intent, Ewun and Dieselboy.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The word hyphy is San Francisco Bay Area slang meaning &quot;hyperactive.&quot; More specifically it is an adjective that describes the music and the urban culture associated with that area. It was created by Oakland-based rapper Keak da Sneak when he used the term on an album he recorded in 1994. The hyphy culture began to emerge in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a response from Bay Area rappers against commercial hip hop for not acknowledging their region for setting trends in the hip hop industry. It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and in this sense can be associated with San Francisco Bay as crunk music is to the Southern United States. An individual is said to &quot;get hyphy&quot; when they dance in an overstated, fast paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overly loud with other people. The phrase &quot;to get hyphy&quot; is similar to the southern phrase &quot;to get crunk&quot;. Those who consider themselves part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior. &lt;p&gt; Although the &quot;hyphy movement&quot; has just recently seen light in mainstream America, it has been a long standing and ever evolving culture in the Bay Area since the early 1990s.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Progressive country is a subgenre of country music developed in the early 1970s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, mainstream country music was dominated by the slick Nashville sound and the rock-influenced Bakersfield sound of artists like Merle Haggard. A new generation of country artists emerged, influenced by contemporary rock music, singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan, and the liberal politics of the 1960s counterculture. &lt;p&gt; Progressive country was a songwriter-based movement and many key artists had previously seen success writing for other artists in Nashville, writing for themselves, they were more concerned with expanding country music than creating hits. Foremost among these artists was Willie Nelson, who returned to Texas after deciding to focus on performing his own songs. Nelson soon attained a wide following and inspired other artists in Texas and Nashville. &lt;p&gt; By the mid-1970s, progressive country artists entered the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions by other artists. Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged, more rock-oriented variant that achieved wide success in the late 1970s, as well as cowpunk and alternative country artists in the 1980s through today.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo of between 125 and mid 160 beats per minute, repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that builds up and down throughout a track. Trance is a genre on its own, but also will include other styles of electronic music such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, and film music. &lt;p&gt; A trance refers to a state of hypnotism and lessened consciousness. This drifting sensation is portrayed in the genre by mixing many layers and rhythms to create build and release. For example, a characteristic of virtually all trance songs is the soft mid-song breakdown, beginning with and occurring after the orchestration is broken down and the rhythm tracks fade out rapidly, leaving the melody, atmospherics, or both to stand alone for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Although the genre can be devoid of vocals, with mixes done by semi-amateurs posted online at informal locations, mixers who have gained recognition of major labels put out mixes for the radio market with mostly but not limited to female vocals, notably photogenic.</skos:definition>

Notable producers that have worked in this genre include the Freemasons, Soul Central, Armand van Helden, StoneBridge, Seamus Haji, Moto Blanco and Mikey High Jinks. &lt;p&gt; The genre is commercially popular, with record labels such as Defected Records, Ministry of Sound, Hed Kandi, and Fierce Angel all releasing compilation albums dedicated to the genre.

It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, broken beat, drum and bass, jungle, dub and reggae. In the UK the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies. &lt;p&gt; The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as B-sides of 2-step garage single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the &quot;Forward&quot; night, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep.</skos:definition>

Though elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. &lt;p&gt; The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; now has at least two different meanings, both in common usage: referring to the first wave of music that originated in the US in the 1950s and would later develop into the more encompassing international style known as &quot;rock music&quot;, and as a term simply synonymous with the rock music and culture in the broad sense. For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition. &lt;p&gt; In the earliest rock and roll styles of the late 1940s and early 1950s, either the piano or saxophone was often the lead instrument, but these were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s.</skos:definition>

The integration of funk, soul, and R&amp;B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals. &lt;p&gt; Jazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club-circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Similar genres include soul jazz and jazz fusion, but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&amp;B versus some of the jazz fusion production.</skos:definition>

An independent meaning of &quot;Ethno Jazz&quot; emerged around 1990 with globalisation and later the Internet as well as the commercial success of Ethno groups and musicians. From the American and European view, interpretations from developing countries, particularly the developing southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China, became important. &lt;p&gt; Whereas global regions like India, Latin America and Africa had been reached already before 1990, they regained importance in the form of Ethno Music, and Ethno Jazz in particular. Notable examples are the emergence of jazz through the interaction between New Orleans and Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz in the 1940s and 50s, Arab influence in Jazz in the 1950s and 60s and Indian influence through The Beatles and Rock Jazz of the 1960s and 70s. &lt;p&gt; Ethno Jazz, particularly from the 1990s, meant Jazz was in accordance with the more American and European view, but realised with the typical musical differences of non-American and -European regions, particularly the expanding centres of Southeast Asia and China. Superficially, and out of an American and European view, Ethno Jazz is sometimes not as Jazz, but probably something similar missing a more suitable classification.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gothic metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that combines the heaviness of doom metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. &lt;p&gt; Pioneers of gothic metal include Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema, all from the north of England. Other pioneers from the first half of the 1990s include Pyogenesis from Germany, Type O Negative, Saviour Machine from the United States, Tiamat from Sweden, and The Gathering from the Netherlands. Norwegian band Theatre of Tragedy developed the &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a contrast that has since been adopted by many gothic metal groups. During the mid-1990s, Moonspell, Theatres des Vampires and Cradle of Filth brought the gothic approach to black metal.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gypsy punk is a hybrid musical genre that crosses traditional Romani music with punk rock. One of the first rock groups to incorporate elements of punk and Gypsy music was Motherhead Bug, which was active mostly in the early 1990s. A broader audience became aware of the genre after the band Gogol Bordello released the album Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike, with front man Eugene Hütz describing their performance as a &quot;Gypsy Punk Cabaret&quot;. The term &quot;Gypsy punk&quot; then came to describe the genre and then came under criticism as it was considered exploitative of Roma culture. Gogol Bordello have since insisted it was just the name of their album, which was then taken and used by the music press as a term to define the genre of their music and similar artists — not an offshoot term for authentic Gypsy music. &lt;p&gt; Gypsy punk bands usually combine rock beats and instrumentation with more traditional Gypsy instrumentation such as drums, tambourine, accordion, fiddle, trumpet and saxophone. In addition, due to the varied ethnic makeup of the Gypsy culture, many bands sing in several different languages, often switching language many times within a single song.</skos:definition>

The ska-jazz movement that began in New York during the 1990s by pioneering avant-garde jazz musicians that pushed the boundaries of reggae music, combining traditions with modern tendencies, using the reggae beat along with high improvisation and jazz harmonies, primarily by horns and percussion. &lt;p&gt; The ancient origin of jazz is West African music, although the instruments used, guitar, bass, saxophone, trombone, drums, clarinet and piano, all come from the European world. It predates rocksteady and was the harbinger of Jamaican reggae and English Two-tone movement. Ska is characterized by the staccato rhythm played on the guitar and its history can be classified into three periods— Jamaican reggae, also known as First Wave, the English Two-Tone era, commonly called Second Wave, the punk-infused Third Wave.</skos:definition>

Bubblegum's classic period ran from 1967 to 1972. A second wave of bubblegum started two years later and ran until 1977 when disco took over and punk rock emerged. &lt;p&gt; The genre was predominantly a singles phenomenon rather than an album-oriented one. Also, because many acts were manufactured in the studio using session musicians, a large number of bubblegum songs were by one-hit wonders. Among the best-known acts of bubblegum's golden era are 1910 Fruitgum Company, The Ohio Express and The Archies, an animated group which had the most successful bubblegum song with &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, Billboard Magazine's No. 1 single for 1969. Singer Tommy Roe, arguably, had the most bubblegum hits of any artist during this period, notably 1969's &quot;Dizzy&quot;.</skos:definition>

The term is also frequently applied as a generic term for any form of easy listening, smooth jazz, or middle of the road music, or to the type of recordings commonly heard on &quot;beautiful music&quot; radio stations. &lt;p&gt; Elevator music is typically set to a very simple melody so that it can be unobtrusively looped back to the beginning. The dynamic range is also normally reduced, so that the highs and lows do not distract listeners. In a mall or shopping center, elevator music of a specific type has been found to have a psychological effect: slower, more relaxed music tends to make people slow down and browse longer. Elevator music may also be preferred over broadcast radio stations due to the lack of lyrics and commercial interruptions.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Post-rock is a subgenre of rock music characterized by the influence and use of instruments commonly associated with rock, but using rhythms and &quot;guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures&quot; not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock bands are often without vocals. &lt;p&gt; Don Caballero and Tortoise were among the more prominent bands described as post-rock in the 1990s, but their styles are very different, despite being instrumental bands centered on guitars and drums. As such, the term has been the subject of backlash from listeners and artists alike. &lt;p&gt; Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and early '90s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of contemporary indie rock.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Space age pop is a music genre associated with Mexican and American composers and songwriters in the Space Age of the 1950s and 1960s. It is also called bachelor pad music or lounge music. Space age pop was inspired by the spirit of those times, an optimism based on the strong post-war economy and technology boom, and excitement about humanity's early forays into space. Although there is no specific album, date, or year when the genre was born, producer Irwin Chusid identifies its heyday as &quot;roughly 1954 to 1963—from the dawn of high-fidelity to the arrival of the Beatles.&quot; &lt;p&gt; The music is not limited to a single style, and it is not always easily categorized. There are several styles that can be recognized as an influence: classical composers like Ravel and Debussy, the big bands of the 1940s, and different exotic styles, such as samba, latin, and calypso jazz. Space Age pop is related to the genres of lounge music, exotica, or beautiful music, and may be regarded as a precursor to the musical genre of space music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Skweee is a musical style, with origin in Sweden and Finland. Skweee combines simple synth/chiptune leads and basslines with funk, R&amp;B or soul-like rhythms, overall rendering a stripped-down funky sound. The tracks are mostly entirely instrumental, though there are exceptions. The name Skweee was coined by Daniel Savio, one of the originators of the emerging sound. The name refers to the use of vintage synthesizers in the production process, where the aim is to &quot;squeeze out&quot; the most interesting sounds possible. &lt;p&gt; The current producers are both newcomers and old, experienced producers from the Scandinavian electro and electronica environment. &lt;p&gt; Skweeelicious, a blog dedicated to skweee, and community sites such as MySpace and Nation of Skweee have played a major role in the distribution of skweee music and public exposure of the genre. &lt;p&gt; The major outlets of skweee music are the Swedish record label Flogsta Danshall and Finnish record label Harmönia. Norwegian Dødpop, Canadian Ancient Robot, US Losonofono, US Titched, US Poisonous Gases, Spanish Lo Fi Funk, Finnish Mässy, and French Mazout have since been added to this family.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gypsy jazz is a style of jazz music often said to have been started by guitarist Jean &quot;Django&quot; Reinhardt in the 1930s. Because its origins are largely in France it is often called by the French name, &quot;jazz manouche&quot;, or alternatively, &quot;manouche jazz&quot;, even in English language sources. Some modern dictionaries recommend avoiding using the word &quot;gypsy&quot; because it is felt to have been tainted by its frequent use as a pejorative, dictionaries do not, however, caution against use of the term &quot;gypsy jazz.&quot; &lt;p&gt; Django was foremost among a group of Romani guitarists working in and around Paris in the 1930s through the 1950s, a group which also included the brothers Baro, Sarane, and Matelo Ferret and Reinhardt's brother Joseph &quot;Nin-Nin&quot; Reinhardt. &lt;p&gt; Many of the musicians in this style worked in Paris in various popular Musette ensembles. The Musette style waltz remains an important component in the Gypsy jazz repertoire. Reinhardt was noted for combining a dark, chromatic Gypsy flavor with the swing articulation of the period. This combination is critical to this style of jazz. In addition to this, his approach continues to form the basis for contemporary Gypsy jazz guitar.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">New rave is several types of music that fuse elements of electronic music, new wave, rock, indie, techno, mashup, breakbeat hardcore and electro house. It is most commonly applied to a British-based music scene between 2005 and late 2008 of fast-paced electronica-influenced indie music that celebrated the late 1980s Madchester and rave scenes through the use of neon colours and using the term 'raving' to refer to going nightclubbing. &lt;p&gt; The British music magazine NME is largely responsible for popularising the term throughout 2006 and 2007, until claiming in mid-2008 reviews that &quot;New Rave is over&quot;. The genre has connotations of being a &quot;new&quot; version of rave as well as being a play on the term &quot;new wave&quot;. &lt;p&gt; Klaxons, Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier and Shitdisco are generally accepted as the main exponents of the genre. &lt;p&gt; The aesthetics of the new rave scene are similar to those of the original rave scene, being mostly centred around psychedelic visual effects. Glowsticks, neon and other lights are common, and followers of the scene often dress in extremely bright and fluorescent colored clothing. New Rave has been defined more by the image and aesthetic of its bands and supporters, than by its music. Trash Fashion lead singer, Jet Storm, and Electro heroine Uffie, have been described as the scene's very own pin ups. Nevertheless, the use of electronic instruments, a musical fusion of rock and dance styles, and a particular anarchic, trashy energy are certainly key elements.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Folk metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that developed in Europe during the 1990s, a fusion of heavy metal and traditional folk music. This includes the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles. &lt;p&gt; The earliest folk metal band was Skyclad from England. Their debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1990. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel. Among these early groups, the Irish band Cruachan and the German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as Celtic metal and medieval metal respectively. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow. &lt;p&gt; The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Intelligent dance music is a form of electronic music that emerged in the early 1990s. It was originally influenced by developments in underground dance music such as Detroit techno and various breakbeat styles that were emerging in the UK at that time. Stylistically, IDM tended to rely upon individualistic experimentation rather than adhering to musical characteristics associated with specific genres of dance music. The range of post-techno styles to emerge in the early 1990s were described variously as &quot;art techno&quot;, &quot;ambient techno&quot;, &quot;intelligent techno&quot;, and &quot;electronica&quot;. In the United States, the latter is often used as a catchall term to describe not only downtempo or downbeat/non-dance electronic music but also EDM. &lt;p&gt; The term &quot;IDM&quot; is said to have originated in the United States in 1993 with the formation of the &quot;IDM list&quot;, an electronic mailing list originally chartered for the discussion of music by a number of prominent English artists, especially those appearing on a 1992 Warp Records compilation called Artificial Intelligence.</skos:definition>

In the early 1980s, personal computers became less expensive and more accessible than they had previously been. This led to a proliferation of outdated personal computers and game consoles that had been abandoned by consumers as they upgraded to newer machines. They were in low demand by consumers as a whole, and not difficult to find, making them a highly accessible and affordable method of creating sound or art. While it has been a mostly underground genre, chiptune has had periods of moderate popularity in the 1980s and 21st century, and has influenced the development of electronic dance music.</skos:definition>

In general, the style is harsh and challenging.

Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as John Cage.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music. It encompasses a broad period from roughly the 11th century to the present day. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. European music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music. The term &quot;classical music&quot; did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly &quot;canonize&quot; the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age. The earliest reference to &quot;classical music&quot; recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1836.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted by mouth, as music of the lower classes, and as music with unknown composers. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. One meaning often given is that of old songs, with no known composers; another is music that has been transmitted and evolved by a process of oral transmission or performed by custom over a long period of time.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A concert is a live performance of music before an audience. The performance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, a choir, or a musical band. Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls, entertainment centres and parks to large multipurpose buildings, and even sports stadiums. Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called &quot;arena concerts&quot; or &quot;amphitheatre concerts&quot;. Regardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage. Concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment. Before recorded music, concerts would provide the only opportunity one would generally have to hear musicians play. Informal names for a concert include &quot;show&quot; and &quot;gig&quot;</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">African popular music, like African traditional music, is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many genres of popular music like blues, jazz, salsa, zouk, and rumba derive to varying degrees on musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by African slaves. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like rock, and rhythm and blues. Likewise, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and recording studio techniques of western music</skos:definition>
